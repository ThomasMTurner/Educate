# Educate
Custom search engine built for academic research, educational content & learning, built with Rust and React.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to built a search application which is primarily focused around educational resources, learning materials & informative ( as well as legitimately sourced ) content. It is built around two primary features, a fully local search engine & a meta search engine. Results are aggregated from all of these sources, and final outputs are provided as links to these sources ( browser re-direct ) & summarisations ( with a locally sourced LLM ).
